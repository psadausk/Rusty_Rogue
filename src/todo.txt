1) Add speed
    - Every action takes a certain number of turns 
    - Interuptable actions?
    - need an option to wait/skip an action (wait until the next thing acts, then act)
    - This enables certain things like an arrow moving multiple consecutive turns, before the player goes
        and allowing the player to see along the arrow's path

    - Test this using a fire arrow that moves over distance. It should appear to moves
    - Work with ai and enemies maybe? 
        - Have some enemies that move/act twice perturn
        - Maybe even have larger with multiple parts that move at different speeds

2) Light sources
    Light has 
        1) intensity
            -fades over time per some factor
        2) fade factor?
            - the factor at which intensity fades over time
            - Could be non linear?
        3) Raduis
            Should this be tied directly into intensity? The more intense a light is, the larger the radius?
        4) Angle
            - Most lights wouldbe 365, but a flash light could be narrower, but brighter
4) FIRE
    Light source that spreads. Objects need a burnable factor   
        - How easily they catch on fire
        - How long it stays on fire
        - How intense is the fire (light source?)


5) new map types?
    Outdoor forest
        - wide open area 
6) doors?
    Cannot see into a room until door has been open
    Ability to re close a door
7) action 
    Player needs to be able to interact with the enviroment

8) Figure out better plan for graphics
    Stick with ascii art? Or use sprites?
        ASCII art is easier to shade I thinkk, although it may be simple to add a shaded pallete
    Figure out out to deal with larger enemies...I guess inclduing in animate objects such as  trees
